Purpose and Scope
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Arkanoid game repository, a web-based implementation of the classic arcade breakout-style game. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and visual assets to create a playable browser-based version of Arkanoid with a retro gaming aesthetic.

This overview covers the high-level architecture, key components, and technical implementation approach. For detailed analysis of the HTML structure and game board implementation, see HTML Structure. For comprehensive coverage of the visual styling system, see CSS Styling System. For information about asset integration and typography, see Visual Assets.

System Architecture
The Arkanoid game follows a client-side web application architecture with clear separation of concerns between structure, presentation, and assets. The system is designed around a table-based game board approach with CSS-driven visual styling.

File Structure and Dependencies
The repository follows a simple but effective structure for a web-based game implementation:

File	Purpose	Key Elements
index.html	Game structure and layout	table grid, div#bola, td#barra, span#puntaje
style.css	Visual styling and asset integration	@font-face, color schemes, layout rules
fonts/RETROTECH.ttf	Typography asset	TrueType font for retro aesthetic
img/fondoretro.jpg	Background image	Full-page retro background
img/barra.png	Paddle sprite	Visual representation of player paddle
README.md	Project identification	Repository name and purpose
Technical Implementation Approach
Table-Based Game Board Architecture
The system uses an HTML table as the primary game board structure, with each cell (td) representing a discrete game space. This approach provides several advantages:

Grid-based positioning: Natural alignment for block-based gameplay
CSS styling flexibility: Each cell can be individually styled
Collision detection foundation: Clear boundaries for game entity interactions
The game board is implemented as a 15-row by 8-column table

 with specific rows designated for different purposes:

Rows 1-2: Score display area using colspan and rowspan 
index.html
14
Rows 3-8: Block areas with color-coded classes fila3 through fila8 
index.html
20-84
Rows 9-15: Game play area with vacio (empty) cells

Asset Integration Strategy
The CSS file implements a comprehensive asset loading strategy through multiple mechanisms:

Game Entity Implementation
The system defines game entities through specific HTML elements with corresponding CSS styling:

Ball Entity: div#bola positioned within a table cell 
index.html
144
 styled as a white circle 
style.css
83-90
Paddle Entity: td#barra spanning 2 columns 
index.html
154
 with sprite background 
style.css
77-82
Block Entities: Color-coded td elements with classes fila3 through fila8 
index.html
20-84
 each with distinct colors 
style.css
43-72
Missing Components
The architecture reveals the foundation for a complete game but lacks the JavaScript layer that would implement:

Game loop and animation
Ball physics and movement
Collision detection algorithms
User input handling for paddle control
Score calculation and game state management
This suggests the current codebase represents the visual and structural foundation, with game logic intended to be implemented separately.
